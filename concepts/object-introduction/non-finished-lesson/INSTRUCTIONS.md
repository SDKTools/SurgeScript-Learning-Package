# Happy, 2025!(state countdown) NOT DONE YET

To switch state just run the code `state = <new_state>`. 
To wait time use the function `timeout(<seconds>)`. 
Make it start at the state 10, then it prints 10, waits 1 second and go to nine, and this until the end, which after 1 sec prints: "Happy, 2025!"
