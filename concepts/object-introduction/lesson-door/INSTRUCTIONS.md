# Door
Each object has a state, it starts on state "main", but you can change it

To switch state just run the code `state = <new_state>`. 
To wait time use the function `timeout(<seconds>)`. 
Make the door closed and make it print closed, after 2 seconds make it open and to print open, then end the application after 2 seconds(you don't need to actually timeout, but this makes the code more door-like)
