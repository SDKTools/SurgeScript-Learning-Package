First, you must download it. You can do that by running this command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/SDKTools/SurgeScript-Learning-Package
```

For Linux users things get a little bit more complicated.

1- Compile [SurgeScript](https://github.com/alemart/surgescript) manually

2- Install [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.4) on Linux

3- Put surgescript and it's libraries into the surgescript folder.

4- Rename the surgescript executable to surgescript.exe, and check if the 
program can be executed.

Now that you have installed everything, go to the "concepts" folder and do the lessons.
